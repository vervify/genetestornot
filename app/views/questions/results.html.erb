				<h3 class="purple">Family Risks?</h3>
				<p>If a member of your immediate family (parents or siblings) has been diagnosed with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, you may have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. In this section you explored your family history.</p>
				<p class="you-answered">You answered: <strong id="family"></strong></p>
			</div>
			<div class="results-item">
				<h3 class="purple">Useful Info?</h3>
				<p>The gene test for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease can reveal an increased risk of getting the disease, but it cannot give you a definitive answer whether you will or won’t develop it. This section discussed how much increased risk you might have if you have inherited one or two copies of the APOE e4 gene. However, many people with the APOE e4 gene will not get Alzheimer’s disease, and people without the gene can develop it.</p>

			<div class="results-item">
				<h3 class="purple">Is Timing Right?</h3>
				<p>Timing of genetic testing is important. It is best done when things are calm enough in your life so you have time to think it through.</p>
				<p class="you-answered">You answered: <strong id="timing"></strong></p>
			</div>
			<div class="results-item">
				<h3 class="purple">Pros vs Cons?</h3>
				<p>Genetic information has personal, family and societal consequences. In this section we presented stories to explore a number of advantages and disadvantages that might affect your decision whether or not to get gene testing. </p>
